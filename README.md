## Overview
The code uses `sp_global_scraper.py` and utility functions in `utils.py` to extract and structure data in a usable format.  The scraper class `SPGlobalScraper` in `sp_global_scraper.py` manages the process of gathering data from SP Globalâ€™s press releases by year. 

Key features include:
- Extracting data across a specified period of time.
- Structuring columns for consistent output.

## Installation
To install and run this code, ensure you have the necessary Python packages:
```bash
pip install pandas requests beautifulsoup4
```

Clone or download this repository, then navigate to the project directory.

## Usage
### Quickstart Example
With the modules provided, you can run a complete scrape by simply creating an instance of `SPGlobalScraper` and using the `extract_tables_from_all_years` function. This script requires a start and end date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, and the output will be saved in CSV format.

```python
from sp_global_scraper import SPGlobalScraper

# Run the scraper for 2021
scraper = SPGlobalScraper(start_date="2021-01-01", end_date="2021-12-31")
scraper.extract_tables_from_all_years()
```

This code will:
1. Retrieve relevant press release links.
2. Extract tables from each URL and log any URLs with no table.
3. Save the combined cleaned data into a CSV file.

## File Output
Running the scraper will save the results to a file named `press_releases_{start_year}_{end_year}.csv` in the working directory.
